<info>Leonard and Sheldon are brilliant physicists, the kind of "beautiful minds" that understand how the universe works. But none of that genius helps them interact with people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty named Penny moves in next door. Sheldon, Leonard's roommate, is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow Caltech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities ... including love.</info>

<info>Chuck Lorre (Two and a Half Men) & Bill Prady ("Dharma & Greg") co-created this new comedy about a pair of brilliant physicists -- roommates Leonard (Johnny Galecki - "Roseanne") and Sheldon (Jim Parsons - "Judging Amy," "Garden State") -- who understand how the universe works but have no clue about how to interact with people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty named Penny (Kaley Cuoco, "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter") moves in next door. Sheldon is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow Caltech scientists Wolowitz (Simon Helberg -- "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip") and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar, "Huck & Holden"). However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities ... including love.</info>

<info>In series 4 of the sitcom, Sheldon (Jim Parsons) begins an unorthodox relationship with an equally brilliantâ€”and equally awkwardâ€”neuroscientist named Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Bialik, who is bumped from recurring cast member to series regular by the end of the season). Meanwhile, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) starts dating a new woman, but there's only one problem: She's Raj's (Kunal Nayyar) sister, and he's not too happy about it. Kaley Cuoco and Simon Helberg also star.</info>

<info>Viewers should get a great big bang out of series 7 of the nerd-com. Unlucky-at-love-Raj (Kunal Nayyar) gets a girlfriend and then loses her, and later becomes a bit of a Don Juan as he not only becomes involved with another woman, but actually dates two for a time. Sheldon (Jim Parsons) makes an accidental scientific breakthrough, but his glory is short-lived. On the plus side, he is positively charged when his childhood hero, Professor Proton (Bob Newhart), pays a couple of visits, and Sheldon also interacts with Science Guy Bill Nye (as himself). As for him and Amy (Mayim Bialik), she takes a job at the university, putting their relationship to the test, and later they go on a romantic Valentine's Day getaway to Napa Valley. On the acting front, Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting)lands a role on NCIS and bags a part in a sleazy, low-budget horror flick, and her relationship with Leonard (Johnny Galecki) heads into uncharted territory. As for newlyweds Howard and Bernadette (Simon Helberg, Melissa Rauch), they host Thanksgiving dinner for the gang and Howard contemplates heading back into space. Big-name guests for this season include James Earl Jones, Carrie Fisher and Wil Wheaton. Christine Baranski and Laurie Metcalf reprise their roles as Leonard and Sheldon's mothers, respectively.</info>

<info>This action-adventure chronicles the escapades of a swashbuckling and brutal pirate, Captain Flint (Toby Stephens), his shipmates and his rivals in the early 18th-century C aribbean. The series is a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island," and is set 20 years before the events depicted in that literary classic. While bounding the Spanish Main and jolly-rogering across the seas, Flint accepts a young recruit, John Silver (Luke Arnold), to join his crew, while later quashing a mutiny, questing for treasures, broadsiding other pirate vessels and exchanging fire with the ships of the British Navy who have been charged with blowing Flint out of the water.</info>

<info>Eddie and Richie are two pathetic, slobby, bachelor flatmates living in a filthy, damp flat at 11 Mafeking Parade in Hammersmith, London. Mayall described them as "unemployed survivors" [6]. They spend their time concocting desperate schemes to convince women to have sex with them, including buying sex spray, forging money, and pretending to be aristocrats. Their plans are never successful however, and the stress of their miserable lives can cause them to become irritable with each other. Whenever tensions hit breaking point, Richie and Eddie fight, violently (albeit in a comical, Tom and Jerry-style, with adult themes). Both men are in their early forties, but still express a degree of immaturity. Richie is a virgin; he's insecure and lonely, and clueless on how to talk to women. Despite being a penniless slob, he occasionally projects a pompous sort of snobbery in an attempt to impress others and boost his self-esteem; he's sexually frustrated and obsessed with losing his virginity. Eddie, the more popular of the two, enjoys drinking regularly, and often secretly steals family heirlooms and cash from Richie, although he occasionally has inventive moments, like building a cash forger, an electric toilet, and even a time machine. Eddie's friends â€” the gormless Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog â€” both fear Richie, believing him to be psychotic. Although the four of them sometimes venture out, usually to the local pub, the Lamb and Flag, most of the episodes are set within the confines of the squalid flat.</info>

<info>Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson give the flat-share sitcom a much needed kick up the Bottom in the show which, alongside Men Behaving Badly (1992-8) injected new life into a legendarily dire genre. With glorious comic gusto they play Richie Rich and Eddie Hitler, a pair of misfits barely surviving unemployment in a Hammersmith hovel. They spend their life in frustration, minus female company or money, in facile schemes to entertain or better themselves, their best intentions always proving the catalyst for hilariously OTT cartoon-style violence. The humour benefits from being rude, crude and surreal, and though happily bereft of subtlety or sense the situations and set-pieces are always superbly constructed, delivered and directed. But that's only to be expected from a show that essentially presents two of The Young Ones a decade down the line.</info>

<info>Season 2 of the gritty Batman prequel finds Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock dragged deeper into the fight for Gotham. The season's first half, subtitled "Rise of the Villains," opens with Gordon being fired from the force and Bullock tendering his resignation; and Gordon teaming with Cobblepot, now a crime boss, in an attempt at being reinstated. Other storylines find Theo Galavan (James Frain) masterminding the escape of a half-dozen murderous maniacs from Arkham Asylum; a new GCPD captain, Nathaniel Barnes (Michael Chiklis), joining forces with Gordon; and Galavan blackmailing Cobblepot into helping his quest to become mayor. The season's second half, subtitled "Wrath of the Villains," finds Cobblepot sent to Arkham Asylum, where he's treated by one Dr. Hugo Strange (BD Wong); the dastardly Mr. Freeze (Nathan Darrow) making his mark; and Bruce investigating his father's secrets.</info>

Regarding Lockjaw, the CGI is poorly done which makes the character stick out and thus makes him not believable. Overall, the show is a big miss.</info>

<info>Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May return for a new season of the world's greatest show about three middle-aged men rampaging around the world having unusual adventures, driving amazing cars, and engaging in a constant argument about which of them is the biggest idiot. Although it's also the only show that combines these things so the 'greatest' title is pretty much uncontested.</info>

<info>After years of preparation, the city of Chicago opens the Chicago World's Fair - a 600-acrea modern marvel meant to memorialize the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World. But as America's best and brightest engineers race to construct the fairgrounds, Dr. H.H. Holmes is constructing his own architectural "masterpiece" - THE MURDER CASTLE. Under the guise of a hotel, the castle is a dark and dangerous death trap filled with staircases to nowhere, sealed "death rooms" and a labyrinth that leads guests to their final resting place</info>
